# express-js-note-taker


## Description

This project was constructed from starter code in order to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. Through this project, I learnt about:

- Express JS
- GET, POST, DELETE and PUT (fetch) requests
- API and HTML routing
- Query parameters
- Static Assets and Middleware
- Insomnia to test fetch requests
- Modularising
- Render

The image below shows the application.
